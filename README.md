Introduction<br>
This survey paper first provides a comprehensive overview of traditional and deep-learning methods for monaural speech enhancement in the frequency domain. The fundamental assumptions of each approach are then summarized and analyzed to clarify their limitations and advantages. A comprehensive evaluation of some typical methods was conducted using the WSJ + DNS and Voice Bank + DEMAND datasets to give an intuitive and unified comparison. The benefits of monaural speech enhancement methods using objective metrics relevant for normal-hearing and hearing-impaired listeners were evaluated.
